# Question 1

Next, you will run some code from the tutorial, so you can see how it works for yourself.  Run the next code cell without changes.
print("Hello, world!")

q1.check()

#Question 2 
Now, you will print another message of your choosing. To do this, change print("Your message here!") to use a different message. For instance, you might like to change it to something like:
print("Good morning!")
print("I am learning how to code :D")
Or, you might like to see what happens if you write something like print("3+4"). Does it return 7, or does it just think of "3+4" as just another message?
Make sure that your message is enclosed in quotation marks ("), and the message itself does not use quotation marks. For instance, this will throw an error: print("She said "great job" and gave me a high-five!") because the message contains quotation marks. If you decide to take the Python course after completing this course, you will learn more about how to avoid this error in Lesson 6.
Feel free to try out multiple messages!
# TODO: Change the message
print("i think i can fly")
print("3+4")
print(3+4)

Question 3
Use the next code cell to:
- Define a variable `births_per_min` and set it to 250.  (There are on average 250 babies born each minute.)
- Define a variable `births_per_day` that contains the average number of babies born each day.  (To set the value of this variable, you should use `births_per_min` and some of the variables from the previous code cell.)
â€‹
Remember you can always get a hint if you need it!
 TODO: Set the value of the births_per_min variable
births_per_min = 250
hours_per_day = 24
mins_per_hour = 60

# TODO: Set the value of the births_per_day variable
births_per_day = births_per_min * mins_per_hour * hours_per_day
